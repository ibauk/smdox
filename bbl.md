# Brit Butt Light - Scoring

This is how scoring for BBL needs to be handled by the rally team.

## Physical & network configuration
The main server running *ScoreMaster* is a virtual private server running on the public internet accessible using a standard browser at [http://109.228.37.16/sm](http://109.228.37.16/sm)

Up to five laptops can access the system at the same time. ScoreMaster implements basic record locking but team members should decide their own protocols for avoiding conflicts between themselves.

## Check-out
At the start, you will need to capture the odo reading for each rider. Depending on your level fear of technology you can do this on paper for later entry to ScoreMaster or you can take a tablet or laptop out to the carpark and do it there and then.

To enter the start odo readings choose [Rally setup & config][Entrants][Odometer check-out] and enter the readings next to the names. For odos counting kilometres, change the M to K.

This is an EBC event and all bonus claims will be submitted by email by entrants using the email address held for them on their entrant record. This is normally the address used to register for the rally but anyone wishing to use a different address must inform the team before starting the rally. It is possible to permit more than one address for an entrant in which cases the addresses are entered into the entrant's email field separated by commas.

## Claims judging
Claims where the rider can't be positively identified by number and matching email will be left untouched in the Gmail mailbox, address **ibaukebc@gmail.com** and will need to be examined manually by the team. Bob will deal with such mails.

Claims which conform to the rules will appear in the list accessed from the main ScoreMaster menu button [EBC claims judging](#judging-ebc-claims).

Individual claims should be judged according to the rules and specifications in the rally book, either a claim complies or it doesn't, there is no need for "negotiation".

## Judging EBC claims
Claims imported automatically to the database are presented for judging in the "EBC claims judging" schedule. These screens are optimised both for keyboard and mouse use. On the list screen, hitting [Enter] will present the first claim for judging.

The claim judging screen presents the rally book image on the right with the claim image highlighted on the left. Icons are presented if any flags (bike in photo, face in photo, etc) are present or if team rules apply along with specific scoring notes (not waffle). You have options: pressing [Esc] will leave the claim unjudged and move it to the bottom of the list; pressing [Enter] will accept as a good claim; pressing [Claim excluded] will exclude the claim from consideration, it will not affect scoring; any other button will reject the claim for cause.


## Fixing wrong judgments
If a claim is found to have been wrongly judged it can be corrected using the "Claims log". Set the filter to "Show all" or "Applied", then click the entrant name on the relevant line. Update the **Decision** and click [Save record].

This facility can also be used to add claims which originate outside of the normal EBC processing, for example missing claims judged directly on an entrant's phone.

## Check-in
At the end of the rally, entrants will return to rally HQ and have their final odo readings taken and entered to ScoreMaster using [Rally setup & config][Entrants][Odometer check-in]

Entrants will then agree the claims log produced by the system with their own records and be given their scorecard.
