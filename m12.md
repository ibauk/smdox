# Magic 12 - Scoring

This is how scoring for M12 will be handled by the rally team.

## Physical & network configuration
The main server running *ScoreMaster* is a virtual private server running on the public internet accessible using a standard browser at [http://109.228.37.16/sm](http://109.228.37.16/sm)

Up to five laptops can access the system at the same time. ScoreMaster implements basic record locking but team members should decide their own protocols for avoiding conflicts between themselves.

## Check-out
At the start, odo readings for each rider will need to be captured. Depending on the level of fear of technology this can be done on paper for later entry to ScoreMaster or using a tablet or laptop out to the carpark and do it there and then.

To enter the start odo readings choose [Rally setup & config][Entrants][Odometer check-OUT] and enter the readings next to the names. For odos counting kilometres, choose K; odos counting miles, choose M.

This is an EBC event and all bonus claims will be submitted by email by entrants using the email address held for them on their entrant record. This is normally the address used to register for the rally but anyone wishing to use a different address must inform the team before starting the rally. It is possible to permit more than one address for an entrant in which cases the addresses are entered into the entrant's email field separated by commas.

## Claims judging
Claims where the rider can't be positively identified by number and matching email will be left untouched in the monitored mailbox,  **poi@ibabenelux.org**, and will need to be examined manually by the team. Monitoring needs to be carefully done to avoid conflicts with ScoreMaster's own monitoring.

Claims which conform to the rules will appear in the list accessed from the main ScoreMaster menu button [EBC claims judging](#judging-ebc-claims).

Individual claims should be judged according to the rules and specifications in the rally book, either a claim complies or it doesn't, there is no need for "negotiation" but in general the judge should be looking to give the points rather than to withold them.

## Judging EBC claims
Claims imported automatically to the database are presented for judging in the "EBC claims judging" schedule. These screens are optimised both for keyboard and mouse use. On the list screen, hitting [Enter] will present the first claim for judging.

The claim judging screen presents the rally book image on the right with the claim image highlighted on the left. Icons are presented if any flags (bike in photo, face in photo, etc) are present or if team rules (see below) apply along with specific scoring notes (not waffle). The options are: 

- pressing [Esc] will leave the claim unjudged and move it to the bottom of the list; 
- pressing [Enter] will accept as a good claim; 
- pressing [Claim excluded] will exclude the claim from consideration, it will not affect scoring; 
- any other button will reject the claim for cause.

"Claim excluded" is suitable for cases of non-existent bonus codes, excessive claims, etc. Such claims do not appear on the scorecard.

## Team rules
Entries consisting of a rider and passenger as well as entries acting as a multi-bike team are subject to a rule for each claim that at least one team member must be included in each photo. If a bonus stipulates "Face in photo", all team members must appear.

## Fixing wrong judgments
If a claim is found to have been wrongly judged it can be corrected using the "Claims log". Set the filter to "Show all" or "Applied", then click the entrant name on the relevant line. Update the **Decision** and click [Save record].

This facility can also be used to add claims which originate outside of the normal EBC processing, for example missing claims judged directly on an entrant's phone.

## Check-in

At the end of the rally, entrants will return to rally HQ and have their final odo readings taken and entered to ScoreMaster using [Rally setup & config][Entrants][Odometer check-IN]. They should be advised to check their phones BEFORE completing check-in for any unsent or missing claims. If it is not possible for outstanding claims to be sent for whatever reason, such claims can be entered manually onto ScoreMaster using info held on the phone.

## Rallymaster interview
Entrants will then agree the claims log produced by the system with their own records and be given their scorecard.

To print scorecard/claims log, choose [Review scorecards], choose the entrant then click the appropriate [Print] button.

## Wrapping up
When all entrants are happy and final adjustments made, take a breath, double-check then print certificates and quicklist. These are both options on the front menu.
