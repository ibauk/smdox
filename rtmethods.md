# Empowering Rally Teams - configuring ScoreMaster

## Capture odo/time @ Check-in
At the end of a rally we need to capture final odo readings and finish times for all entrants. This can be done in several ways but a particularly convenient method is to make use of a special bonus code, say, 'ZZ', and enter a bonus claim in the usual way.

Either email a final claim from the carpark or enter a claim manually into the claims log. This has the additional benefit of providing an audit trail which can be reprocessed if necessary.
