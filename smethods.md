# Scoring Methods

ScoreMaster provides automatic processing for the scoring methods described below. If you wish to make use of a scoring mechanism not included here, please speak to Bob.

This document is not concerned with *bonus claim* methods, only with the arithmetic involved in calculating a score.

## Definitions
Points
: A points value is an integer (whole number), fractions are not allowed. In general a points value can be positive or negative.

## Simple bonus points
Each bonus scores a specific number of points.

## Variable bonus points
Each bonus specifies a default value (which might be zero or even negative). At claim time the actual value of the bonus must be entered manually.

## Simple combination bonus
A combination bonus (combo) specifies a list of underlying bonuses (which might include [some] other combos). Each combo scores a specific, fixed, number of points.

## Variable combination bonus
A variable combo specifies a minimum number of underlying bonuses (rather than 'all' for a simple combo). Each combo scores a specific number of points depending on the number of underlying bonuses scored between the minimum and all. A simple example:-

Combo *CLUBS* has underlying bonuses *MANU*,*CHELSEA*,*ARSENAL*,*RANGERS*,*ROVERS*. The combo will be scored if at least three underlying bonuses are scored. The value of the combo is either 100, 200 or 600 points. 

## Compulsory bonuses
Any ordinary or combination bonus can be flagged as being compulsory. Failure to score a compulsory bonus results in DNF.

## Complex methods
Complex methods involve from one to nine sets of categories which are specified for each bonus or combo. Common sets are *Country*, *County*, *Industry*, *Building type*, etc.  For example, an ordinary bonus *F01* might specify *Country*=France, *Industry*=Farming.

In general, the idea is to act on groups of bonuses rather than each bonus. Typically, the first relevant bonus is unaffected by the complex method but two or more will be.

Complex methods can be applied at three levels:- those which affect the individual bonus scores; those which reward sequences of bonuses; those which reward or punish collections of bonuses. Methods at each level can be combined both with the basic bonus scores and other levels.

### Individual bonus scores
Basic bonus scores can be modified by either the number of bonuses scored within a category (*Country* = *France* for example) or the number of categories having at least one bonus scored within a set (number of counties visited within a country).

The classic example of this method is the 2017 Brit Butt Rally in which the value of any bonus depended on the number of bonuses scored within a county. The first bonus was worth one point, the second two points, the third four points, the fourth eight points and so on.

Relatively complex arithmetic can be used in this method. Speak to Bob if you want to know more.

### Sequences
**Uninterrupted** membership of a particular category can be used to award extra points. For example, three consecutive farms results in doubling the points awarded for the farm bonuses. The extra points will always be a multiple of the sum of the points scored by the relevant bonuses.

### Collection of bonuses
This can be used to award extra points based on the number of bonuses scored within a category or the number of categories scored within a set. The criterion at this stage is simple group membership, order of scoring, etc are not relevant.

This method may also be used to force DNF in the event of too many/not enough categories being scored.
