# BBR22 Rally Team

## Talking to entrants
- rules is rules. Don't engage in 'what if' or 'yeah but'
- correct claims will succeed, deviations might succeed, don't deviate
- judging decisions are final, no appeal

## Judging bonus claims
- if claim time is critical, double-check time by clicking the email icon
- if photo doesn't match bonus code, reject "wrong photo"
- check restrictions, reject accordingly
- ignore wrong odo readings
- keep notes of reject decisions with reasons

## Review rejected claims
- use [Review scorecards] mechanism, flag as "Team is happy!"
- different judges reassess to confirm rejection

## Carpark odo readings
- main odo is integer only, no decimal
- odo check requires tenths
- odo check, reset trip and use that
- if odo u/s, ride the check anyway

## Check-in
- occurs in carpark. email flush before odo reading/finish time
- 30 minutes to agree scorecard

## Manual claim processing
- don't process for "at fault" claims
- add claim using [Claims list]
- use sensible claim time if none available
