# Invictus Tour 22 - Scoring

This is how scoring for IT22 needs to be handled by the rally team.

## Physical & network configuration

The main server running *ScoreMaster* is a virtual private server running on the public internet accessible using a standard browser at [http://77.68.117.223/](http://77.68.117.223/). The site is guarded with a front page demanding the access code which is - **inVictus22** - (letter case is important).

Up to five laptops can access the system at the same time. ScoreMaster implements basic record locking but team members should decide their own protocols for avoiding conflicts between themselves.

## Claims judging

This is an Electronic Bonus Claiming event and all bonus claims will be submitted by email by entrants using the email address held for them on their entrant record. This is normally the address used to register for the rally but it might have been updated since then.

Claims coming from an unrecognised email address and claims which are not formatted correctly will be left untouched in the [Gmail mailbox](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox), address **ibaukebc@gmail.com**, password "" to be processed manually by the team. This mailbox must be monitored throughout the rally. See [Manual claims processing](#manual-claims-judging) below.

Claims which conform to the rules will appear in the list accessed from the main ScoreMaster menu button [EBC claims judging](#judging-ebc-claims).

In either case, individual claims should be judged according to the rules and specifications in the rally book, either a claim complies or it doesn't, there is no need for "negotiation".

## Judging EBC claims

Claims imported automatically to the database are presented for judging in the "EBC claims judging" schedule. These screens are optimised both for keyboard and mouse use. On the list screen, hitting [Enter] will present the first claim for judging.

The claim judging screen presents the rally book image on the right with the claim image highlighted on the left. Icons are presented if any flags (bike in photo, face in photo, etc) are present or if team rules apply along with specific scoring notes (not waffle). You have options: pressing [Esc] will leave the claim unjudged; pressing [Enter] will accept as a good claim; any other button will reject the claim for cause.

If a bonus has a question, it will be shown onscreen along with any answer supplied in the claim. Tick the box to award the extra 50 points.

## Manual claims judging

In order to process a claim using the email itself, open the "Claims log", not "EBC claims judging", click the **+** to start a new claim then cut and paste the *Subject:* line of the email into the Entrant field or enter the fields manually, choose a **Decision** and click [Save record].

If a bonus has a question, it will be shown onscreen along with any answer supplied in the claim. Tick the box to award the extra 50 points.

## Fixing wrong judgements

If a claim is found to have been wrongly judged it can be corrected using the "Claims log". Set the filter to "Show all" or "Applied", then click the entrant name on the relevant line. Update the **Decision** and click [Save record].
