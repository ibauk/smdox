## Rest bonuses

1. As is
2. As is

You can claim up to seven hours as rest bonus, in either one or two sessions. A rest bonus period is started by claiming RB0 in the usual way, with a photo of a receipt next to your odometer. The end of the period is claimed using code RB2, RB5 or RB7. Each code may be used only once.

If claiming two rest periods, use RB2 to claim at least two hours; use RB5 to claim at least five hours. If claiming a single period, use RB2, RB5 or RB7 to claim at least two hours, five hours and seven hours respectively.

RB5: 5 hours rest is claimed by emailing a photo of a second receipt next to your odometer. It must show at least 5 hours after your RB0 start receipt, and also show the same location. 20,000 points will be given for your 5 hour Rest Bonus.

RB2: 2 hours rest is claimed by emailing a photo of a second receipt next to your odometer. It must show at least 2 hours after your RB0 start receipt, and also show the same location. 2,000 points will be given for your 2 hour Rest Bonus.

RB7: 7 hours rest is claimed by emailing a photo of a second receipt next to your odometer. It must show at least 7 hours after your RB0 start receipt, and also show the same location. 23,000 points will be given for your 7 hour Rest Bonus.
