# IBA Rally administration - Best Practice

## Stipulated roles

### Rallymaster

## Core functions

### Briefings

#### Rally team briefing
To ensure that everyone involved properly understands their roles and has sufficient knowledge and skill to execute them reliably.

#### Entrant briefing
To ensure that everyone (including rally team) understands the design of the rally, understands Electronic Bonus Claiming (EBC) including judging standards.

#### Novice briefing
To ensure that novices understand what a rally is, what is expected of them, what is not expected of them.

### Odometers

Odometers are used to record distances ridden in the rally. They should be in road-legal working order but we no longer advise the use of odo-check runs. If odometers are not available for whatever reason, substitute the use of satnav data.

#### Check-out procedure
Rally team will record odo at start AND may get entrant to do bonus claim for odo start, confirm that it's all good.

#### Check-in procedure
Rally team will record odo at finish and confirm claims list. Entrants will be asked to sign agreement with their scorecard.
