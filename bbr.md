# BBR Rally Team briefing

## Talking to entrants
- rules is rules. Don't engage in 'what if' or 'yeah but'
- correct claims will succeed, deviations might succeed, don't deviate
- judging decisions are final, no appeal

## Judging bonus claims
- if photo doesn't match bonus code, reject "wrong photo"
- check restrictions, reject accordingly
- exclude claim only when necessary - eg non-existent bonus code
- if claim time is critical, double-check time by clicking the email icon
- ignore wrong odo readings
- keep notes of reject decisions with reasons

## Review rejected claims
- check that bonus restrictions are correctly specified everywhere
- use [Review scorecards] mechanism, flag as "Team is happy!"
- different judges reassess to confirm rejection

## Correcting wrong judgements
-- use [Claims log] or [Review scorecards]
-- choose new Decision
-- save record
-- consider using [Rebuild scorecards] to correct rankings

## Check-in
- occurs in carpark. email check/flush before odo reading/finish time
- 30 minutes to agree scorecard after check-in

## Email monitoring
- at least two monitors
- avoid "reading" new emails before ScoreMaster

## Manual claim processing
- don't process for "at fault" claims
- add claim using [Claims log]
- use sensible claim time if none available
